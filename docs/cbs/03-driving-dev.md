## How to drive implementation?

### How to drive tech team into the implementation?
- Organize in agile way
- Plan and deliver increments in small sprints 
- Facilitate conversations about Architecture 
via regular discussions with the team about current state of the system, 
pain-points and what could be improved

### What instrumentation/strategy would you put in place?
- Share Architectural Documentation with the team, evolve it when needed
- Promote modularisation and well-separated responsibilities of components
- Document *all* interfaces with schemas in API Gateway (in automatic way)

### Which consideration you would make to ensure the system can be maintained, evolved and operated at best?
- Hire best people. Make them responsible for their decisions
- Promote modularisation and well-separated responsibilities of components
- Put in place SLOs. Monitor the SLIs. If the SLOs are not met, prioritise fixing the system
